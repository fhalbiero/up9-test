## 📁 Purpose and Technology 
```bash

    This application was created with the educational purpose, using Javascript, React, 
    ContextAPI to state manager, react-components to styling and json-server to create a fake api 

```


## 📁 Solutions
```bash

    Created a Dashboard UI that allow to to swith from tabs and shows informations about support requests.
    I used the json-server to create an fake api using a provided json file.
    I fetched the data from this api and store in a contextapi to share this data with my components.
    In my dashboard I called another components to compose my page   

```


## 📁 What I shoud do different on a production project
```bash

    The most difference is related to the api, I used a fake api based on a json file.
    A real project I would create my own api to provide this information from database.   

```

    #Clone repository
